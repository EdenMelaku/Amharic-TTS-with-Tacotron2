# Amharic Text to speech with Tacotron2 

This repo is text to speech implemented on **Tacotron2** paper [Natural TTS Synthesis By Conditioning Wavenet On Mel Spectrogram Predictions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05884.pdf)

Basic Model implementation is adobted from [NVIDIA'S tacotron2 implemetation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) and [NVIDIA'S waveglow implementation] (https://github.com/NVIDIA/waveglow). it is implemented by pytorch and it is only supported with GPU. 

I am inspired by Tacotron implementation by [Keith Ito](https://github.com/keithito/tacotron).
